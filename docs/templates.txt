===== Statement of purpose =====

	This document describes the template structure of this project. THIS IS OUTDATED!!

===== Base Template =====

	The template "base/base.html" contains a header (including menu), a footer and the following blocks:
		* title: the title of the HTML page
		* content: the content of the current page


===== Module templates =====

	All modules should extend the base template, which is done by writing {% extends "base/base.html" %} at the
	beginning of the file.

	They need to implement the blocks provided by the base template:

	{% block title%}
	Page title
	{% endblock %}

	{% block content %}
	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	{% endblock %}

===== Statement of Purpose =====

This document describes how you should config PyCharm for this project.

1. Enable Django support

    File -> Settings... -> Project Settings -> Django
    * Django folder should be the folder containing manage.py (GITROOT/studassweb)
    * The settings.py file is in the studassweb folder inside the Django folder.
    * manage.py is in GITROOT/studassweb/manage.py

    If Django doesn't show up in project settings, it probably means that you have the community edition of pyCharm.
    Get the professional one.

2. Get rid of false "undefined reference" errors when importing files from modules in the project

    * Right-click the folder with manage.py.
    * Mark Directory As -> Sources Root

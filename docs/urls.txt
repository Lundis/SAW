===== Statement of Purpose =====

	This document describes how the URL structure work in this project

===== Top dispatcher =====
	At the top of the URL dispatcher chain is studassweb/urls.py. It delegates HTTP requests to the right module.
	At this moment the modules are hardcoded, but in the future a dynamic loader system will be responsible for
	generating the list of modules.

===== App urls.py ======

	Each app that has something to show should have an urls.py file describing what urls it accepts and which view
	handles it. For examples, check the example module.

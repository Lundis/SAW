===== Install Python 3.4 =====

Windows: Make sure that you select "set path variables" when you select the modules to be installed. It is disabled by default.

If you're running Windows 7 or earlier, you need to restart the computer now.

Other OSs: pip might not be installed along with Python. You then need to install it manually using some OS-specific method


===== Install Django 1.7.4 =====

After installing python 3.4 and pip (comes bundled with it on windows):
    > pip install django==1.7.4

To upgrade from a previous version, run:
    > pip install django==1.7.4 --upgrade

===== Install Pycharm pro edition =====

Students can get it for free by applying at http://www.jetbrains.com/student/

Then download it at http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

Enter your jetbrains login details when Pycharm asks for a license.


===== Configure Pycharm =====

1. Enable Django support

    File -> Settings... -> Project Settings -> Django
    * Django folder should be the folder containing manage.py (GITROOT/studassweb)
    * The settings.py file is in the studassweb folder inside the Django folder.
    * manage.py is in GITROOT/studassweb/manage.py

    If Django doesn't show up in project settings, it probably means that you have the community edition of pyCharm.
    Get the professional one.

2. Get rid of false "undefined reference" errors when importing files from modules in the project

    * Right-click the folder with manage.py.
    * Mark Directory As -> Sources Root

3. If you want to, you can remove the built-in git support

    * File -> Settings -> Version Control
    * click the line with git in the table and click the delete button



===== Setting up the database and superuser =====

* initiating/updating the database
    1. Open your shell (windows: powershell) and go to the directory where your manage.py is. (or use pycharm's built-in command run features)
    2. > python manage.py migrate

        * If it fails, you will probably need to delete the database file (db.sqlite3) and rerun migrate

* Creating a superuser
    1. Open your shell and go to the manage.py directory
    2. > python manage.py createsuperuser
        * You will be asked for a username, email (optional) and password
        * enter something simple. for instance "lundis", no email, password "a"

* Create local settings file from template
    1. copy "studassweb/settings_local.py.template"  to  "studassweb/settings_local.py"


REMEMBER TO VISIT LOCALHOST:8000/install to set up the menu.


===== Local settings file =====

You must copy the file
"studassweb/settings_local.py.template"
to
"studassweb/settings_local.py"

the reset_db scripts do this for you if you don't have one, but if it needs to be updated you have to do it yourself.

If you get some settings-related error in the future, try removing the file and copy the template again.
